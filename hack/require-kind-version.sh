# TEMPORARY WORKAROUND — delete this script (and its call in the Makefile
# 'kind-load-local-images' target) once devenv/flake.nix ships kind >=
# $KIND_MIN_VERSION.
#
# kindest/node images for K8s 1.36+ ship a containerd whose config is version 4,
# which only kind >= 0.32.0 can load images into. Older kind fails late and
# cryptically ("unknown containerd config version: 4 (supported versions: 2 and
# 3)") during `kind load`. Cluster *creation* works on older kind, and CI pulls
# images from a registry (no `kind load`), so this guard only runs on the local
# image-load path and fails early with actionable instructions.
#
# Optional env:
#   KIND               path to kind binary (default: kind)
#   KIND_MIN_VERSION   minimum required kind version (default: 0.32.0)

       Install a new-enough kind and point make at it, e.g.:
